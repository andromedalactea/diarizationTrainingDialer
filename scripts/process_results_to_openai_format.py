def process_audio_to_openai_training_format(original_list):
    """
    Processes a list of dictionaries into a format suitable for training with OpenAI.
    Each dictionary in the input list is expected to have 'text' and 'speaker' keys.
    The function unifies consecutive dictionaries with the same 'speaker' value,
    merging their 'text' values into a single string, separated by spaces.
    It also transforms 'speaker' into 'role', determining the most frequent speaker
    as 'assistant' and the less frequent as 'user'.


    Parameters:
    original_list (list): A list of dictionaries, each containing 'text' and 'speaker' keys.


    Returns:
    list: A list of unified dictionaries with 'content' and 'role' keys.
